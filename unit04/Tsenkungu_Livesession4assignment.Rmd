## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The related article is here https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/

```{r college_recent_grads}
install.packages("fivethirtyeight")
library("fivethirtyeight")
df <- college_recent_grads
vignette("fivethirtyeight", package = "fivethirtyeight")
dim(df)
colnames(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
length(colnames(df))
major_count <- table(df$major_category)
par(las=2)
barplot(major_count, las=2, main = "Frequency of College Majors from Carnevale et al", xlab = "Major", ylab = "Frequency", horiz = TRUE, col = "red")
write.csv(df,row.names = FALSE, file = "/Users/tq/Dropbox/Senkungu Fam/Education/SMU/Courses/MSDS 6306 Doing Data Science/GitHub Repo/6306-homework/unit04/college_recent_grads.csv")
```
